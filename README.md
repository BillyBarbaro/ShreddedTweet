ShreddedTweet
==========

My first attempt at a Twitter Bot I wrote in an effort to make the internet a better place.  Periodically searches for tweets using a swear word, then replies to the original tweet, either reprimanding the original user or suggesting a comprable euphamism.

The repository also includes scripts that copies tweets from other users periodically and one that will scrape a random quote from a webpage to tweet, both in an effort to make the account look a little less like a bot.
